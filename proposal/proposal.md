Presentation

1. Mechanisms Introduction

2. Synthesis Introduction

3. Prior Art

4. Goal : Democratization of Design : Building a tool for Non-Expert User to Synthesize Mechanism Concept Designs

5. First Contribution -> Optimal Simultaneous Type and Dim Synthesis for Extended Burmester Problem
  5.1 Motivation - Missing pieces in prior art that resolved after this
  5.2 Contribution

6. Second Contribution -> Shape Matching and Database Query Approach
  6.1 M : How to Incorporate Motion Continuity as whole?
  6.2 Contribution

7. Third Contribution -> Deep Learning for MS : Generative Models and SynthAssist
  7.1 Motivation
    i. User Interaction, input noise => solver susceptiblity
    ii. Mathematically sub-Optimal solutions can be practically optimal, how to find them?
  7.2 Contribution

8. Curiosity Driven Exploration - Database Creation

8 Next Directions
  8.1 Representation of Data: Image Based Approach
     I. Motivation:
        i. consistent way to store and query the information
        ii. Lets you apply constraints which are hard to specify methematically consistent manner
        iii. leverage DL architectures tunes for generating images
        iv. benefits of data bucketizing (reduces the effects of minor observation errors and corresponding sensitivity of model)

  8.2 Type of Data : Spatial Mechanisms and MultiDOF Mechanisms
    I. Motivation:
        i. Type Synthesis of MultiDof Linkages
        ii. Scale the approach to Spatial Domain

  8.3 Architectural/ Algorithmic Improvements
      i. iGAN's
      ii.

  8.4 Synth Assist
      i. Next Gen MotionGen
