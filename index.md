### “First we shape our tools, thereafter they shape us” — Marshall McLuhan, 1967.

Hi! I am currently working as a Research Assistant @ Stony Brook University.
I am working towards bridging the gap between mechanical designer and machine designs with Artificial Intelligence.
My quest is to develop an ML-based framework that connects with inexperienced
designers and empowers them with the state of art machine design algorithms to
invent new machines.

About me, I like to see the big picture. I live in the world of possibilities and become excited about concepts, challenges, and difficulties.
I love to make new friends, travel and learn about different cultures. I like to read, paint, sketch, and play cricket.
From putting together some cool robots to developing new ways computers can empower the masses -- I am interested in it.
