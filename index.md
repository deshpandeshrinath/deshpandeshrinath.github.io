# Shrinath Deshpande

Welcome to my website! I am currently working as Research Assistant @ Stony Brook University.
I am a mechanical engineer fearlessly swimming into deep waters of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence with an intention of sleeping with the fishes.
I fancy Computer Vision and I am thrilled seeing recent breakthroughs in Machine Learning.

From putting together some cool bots to developing new ways computers can help and guide machine designers -- I am interested in it.
