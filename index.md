Hi! I am currently working as a Research Assistant @ Stony Brook University.
I am working towards bridging the gap between mechanical designer and machine designs with Artificial Intelligence.
My quest is to develop an ML-based framework that connects with inexperienced
designers and empowers them with the state of art machine design algorithms to
invent new machines.

About me, I like to see the big picture. I am quick to see complex relationships between things and ideas.
I try to understand things in great depth and have the ability to size up a situation with precision and ease.
I live in the world of possibilities and become excited about concepts, challenges, and difficulties.

From putting together some cool robots to developing new ways computers can empower the masses -- I am interested in it.
