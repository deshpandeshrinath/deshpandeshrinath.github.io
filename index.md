Welcome to my website! I am currently working as Research Assistant @ Stony Brook University.
I am a mechanical engineer fearlessly swimming into deep waters of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

I like to see the big picture. I am quick to see complex relationships between people, things, and ideas.
I try to understand things in great depth and have the ability to size up a situation with precision and ease.
I live in the world of possibilities and become excited about concepts, challenges, and difficulties.

From putting together some cool bots to developing new ways computers can help and guide machine designers -- I am interested in it.
